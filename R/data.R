#' @title U.S. macroeconomic data used in Virolainen (2025)
#'
#' @description A quarterly U.S. data covering the period from 1954Q3 to 2021Q4 (270 observations) and consisting four variables:
#' the log-difference of real GDP, the log-difference of GDP implicit price deflator, the log-difference of producer
#' price index (all commodities), and an interest rate variable. The interest rate variable is the effective federal funds
#' rate from 1954Q3 to 2008Q2 and after that the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate, which is not constrained by the zero lower
#' bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures. The log-differences of the GDP, GDP deflator,
#' and producer price index are multiplied by hundred. This data is used in Virolainen (2025).

#' @title U.S. macroeconomic data
#'
#' @description A quarterly U.S. data covering the period from 1954Q3 to 2021Q4 (270 observations) and consisting four variables:
#' cyclical component of the log of real GDP, the log-difference of GDP implicit price deflator, the log-difference of producer
#' price index (all commodities), and an interest rate variable. The interest rate variable is the effective federal funds
#' rate from 1954Q3 to 2008Q2 and after that the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate, which is not constrained by the zero lower
#' bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures. The log-differences of the GDP deflator and producer price
#' index are multiplied by hundred.
#'
#' The cyclical component of the log of real GDP was obtained by applying a one-sided Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with the
#' standard smoothing parameter lambda=1600. The one-sided filter was obtained from the two-sided HP filter by applying the
#' filter up to horizon t, taking the last observation, and repeating this procedure for the full sample t=1,...,T.
#' In order to allow the series to start from any phase of the cycle, we applied the one-sided filter to the full available
#' sample from 1947Q1 to 2021Q1 before extracting our sample period from it. We computed the two-sided HP filters with the R
#' package lpirfs (Adämmer, 2021)

#' @title Euro area macroeconomic data used in Virolainen (2022)
#'
#' @description A monthly Euro area data covering the period from January 1999 to December 2021 (276 observations) and consisting four variables:
#' cyclical component of log industrial production index, the log-difference of harmonized consumer price index, the log-difference
#' of Brent crude oil prices (Europe), and an interest rate variable. The interest rate variable is the Euro overnight index average
#' rate (EONIA) from January 1999 to October 2008, and after that the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate, which is not constrained by the zero lower
#' bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures. The log-difference of the harmonized consumer price index is
#' multiplied by hundred and the log-difference of oil price by ten. This data is the one that was used in Virolainen (2022).
#'
#' The cyclical component of the log of industrial production index was obtained by applying the linear projection filter proposed
#' by Hamilton (2018) using the parameter values h=24 and p=12. In order to obtain as accurate estimates as possible, we applied the
#' filter to the full available sample from January 1991 to December 2021 before extracting our sample period from it.
