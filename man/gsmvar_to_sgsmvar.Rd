\title{Switch from two-regime reduced form GMVAR, StMVAR, or G-StMVAR model to a structural model.}
\usage{
gsmvar_to_sgsmvar(gsmvar, calc_std_errors = TRUE, cholesky = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsmvar}{an object of class \code{'gsmvar'}, typically created with \code{fitGSMVAR} or \code{GSMVAR}.}

\item{calc_std_errors}{should approximate standard errors be calculated?}

\item{cholesky}{if \code{M == 1}, should the lower triangular Cholesky identification be employed?
See details for using Cholesky identification with \code{M > 1}.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{'gsmvar'} defining a structural GMVAR, StMVAR, or G-StMVAR model based on a
  two-regime reduced form GMVAR, StMVAR, or G-StMVAR model, with the main diagonal of the B-matrix normalized to be
  positive.
}
\description{
\code{gsmvar_to_sgsmvar} constructs SGMVAR, SStMVAR, or SG-StMVAR model based on a reduced
  form GMVAR, StMVAR, or G-StMVAR model.
}
\details{
The switch is made by simultaneously diagonalizing the two error term covariance matrices
  with a well known matrix decomposition (Muirhead, 1982, Theorem A9.9) and then normalizing the
  diagonal of the matrix W positive (which implies positive diagonal of the B-matrix). Models with
  more that two regimes are not supported because the matrix decomposition does not generally
  exists for more than two covariance matrices. If the model has only one regime (= regular SVAR model),
  a symmetric and pos. def. square root matrix of the error term covariance matrix is used \strong{unless}
  \code{cholesky = TRUE} is set in the arguments, in which case Cholesky identification is employed.

  In order to employ a structural model with Cholesky identification and multiple regimes (\code{M > 1}),
  use the function \code{GIRF} directly with a reduced form model (see \code{?GIRF}).

  The columns of \eqn{W} as well as the lambda parameters can be re-ordered (without changing the implied
  reduced form model) afterwards with the function \code{reorder_W_columns}. Also all signs in any column
  of \eqn{W} can be swapped (without changing the implied reduced form model) afterwards with the function
  \code{swap_W_signs}. These two functions work with models containing any number of regimes.
