\title{DEPRECATED! USE THE FUNCTION alt_gsmvar INSTEAD!
Construct a GMVAR model based on results from an arbitrary estimation round of \code{fitGSMVAR}}
\usage{
alt_gmvar(
  gmvar,
  which_round = 1,
  which_largest,
  calc_cond_moments = TRUE,
  calc_std_errors = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gmvar}{object of class 'gmvar'}

\item{which_round}{based on which estimation round should the model be constructed? An integer value in 1,...,\code{ncalls}.}

\item{which_largest}{based on estimation round with which largest log-likelihood should the model be constructed?
An integer value in 1,...,\code{ncalls}. For example, \code{which_largest=2} would take the second largest log-likelihood
and construct the model based on the corresponding estimates. If used, then \code{which_round} is ignored.}

\item{calc_cond_moments}{should conditional means and covariance matrices should be calculated?
Default is \code{TRUE} if the model contains data and \code{FALSE} otherwise.}

\item{calc_std_errors}{should approximate standard errors be calculated?}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{'gsmvar'} defining the specified reduced form or structural GMVAR,
  StMVAR, or G-StMVAR model. Can be used to work with other functions provided in \code{gmvarkit}.

  Note that the first autocovariance/correlation matrix in \code{$uncond_moments} is for the lag zero,
  the second one for the lag one, etc.

\description{
DEPRECATED! USE THE FUNCTION alt_gsmvar INSTEAD! \code{alt_gsmvar} constructs
  a GMVAR model based on results from an arbitrary estimation round of \code{fitGSMVAR}.
}
\details{
It's sometimes useful to examine other estimates than the one with the highest log-likelihood. This function
  is wrapper around \code{GSMVAR} that picks the correct estimates from an object returned by \code{fitGSMVAR}.
