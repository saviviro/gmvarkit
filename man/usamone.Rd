\description{
A quarterly U.S. data covering the period from 1954Q3 to 2021Q4 (270 observations) and consisting four variables:
cyclical component of the log of real GDP, the log-difference of GDP implicit price deflator, the log-difference of producer
price index (all commodities), and an interest rate variable. The interest rate variable is the effective federal funds
rate from 1954Q3 to 2008Q2 and after that the Wu and Xia (2016) shadow rate, which is not constrained by the zero lower
bound and also quantifies unconventional monetary policy measures. The log-differences of the GDP deflator and producer price
index are multiplied by hundred.

The cyclical component of the log of real GDP was obtained by applying a one-sided Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter with the
standard smoothing parameter lambda=1600. The one-sided filter was obtained from the two-sided HP filter by applying the
filter up to horizon t, taking the last observation, and repeating this procedure for the full sample t=1,...,T.
In order to allow the series to start from any phase of the cycle, we applied the one-sided filter to the full available
sample from 1947Q1 to 2021Q1 before extracting our sample period from it. We computed the two-sided HP filters with the R
package lpirfs (Adämmer, 2021)
